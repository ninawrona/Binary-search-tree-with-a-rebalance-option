# Binary search tree with a rebalance option
 ADS University Assignment 2

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:

Before you start coding consider the ADT and make sure you know exactly what to do. You are going to make a generic tree, that isa tree that can store any kind of type (but for the BST it must implement the comparable interface). The traversals return an ArrayList of the objects in the tree, you don’t need to return an iterator. You don’t need to support more than one occurrence ofeach element either.It’s recommended to build the tree in phases:1.A binary tree2.A binary search tree with add and remove3.A binary search tree with rebalance(not to be mistaken with a self-balancing treesuch as an AVL or red-black tree)Test driven development is well suited for the assignmentsince it can be broken into smaller bits that can be test on their own. Besides, it is a requirement that all parts of the code are well tested. When you encounter errors, it can be useful to see a graphical representation of the tree.To that end I have uploaded the source code for a simple ascii code printout of a tree, but you are welcome to make a nicer graphical presentation (it is not a requirement).Remember that in phase one there are no add or delete methods. This is because a general binary tree does not have a specific ordering. In order to create a tree, you must manually do it by creating and combining nodes.
